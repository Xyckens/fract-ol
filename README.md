# fract-ol 
Fract-ol project developed by me for 42 in a Ubuntu environment.
In the mandatory part we need to present the Julia and Mandelbrot Fractal Sets. For the bonus we are asked to choose another Set and I chose the Burning Ship (calculated by only using the real part of th Mandelbrot calculations).
